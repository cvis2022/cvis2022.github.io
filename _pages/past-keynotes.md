        abstract: 
            "Artificial intelligence powered by deep neural networks has reached a level of complexity where it can be difficult or impossible to express how a model makes its decisions. This black-box problem is especially concerning when the model makes decisions with consequences for human well-being. In response, an emerging field called explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to increase the interpretability, fairness, and transparency of machine learning. In this talk I will describe how cognitive psychologists can make contributions to XAI. The human mind is also a black box, and cognitive 
            psychologists have over one hundred and fifty years of experience modeling it through experimentation. We aim to translate the methods and rigour of cognitive psychology to the study of artificial black boxes in the service of explainability. 


            The outline of the talk is as follows: I will provide a review of XAI for non-experts, arguing that current methods possess a blind spot that can be complemented by the experimental cognitive tradition. I will then provide a framework for research in XAI, and highlight exemplary cases of experimentation within XAI inspired by psychological science. Today's XAI methods rely on access to model architecture and parameters that is not always feasible for most users, practitioners, and regulators. I will end the talk by describing a psychology-inspired technique that uses response times (RTs). RTs are observable without privileged access to the model. Moreover, dynamic inference models performing conditional computation generate variable RTs for visual learning tasks. These depend on how the hierarchy of features learned by the network are utilized in prediction. I will show how this method can cast a light on deep neural nets without opening up the black box."

            "In this talk, Dr. Tiwari will focus on her lab’s recent efforts in developing radiomic (extracting computerized sub-visual features from radiologic imaging), radiogenomic (identifying radiologic features associated with molecular phenotypes), and radiopathomic (radiologic features associated with pathologic phenotypes) techniques to capture insights into the underlying tumor biology as observed on non-invasive routine imaging. She will focus on applications of this work for predicting disease outcome, recurrence, progression and response to therapy specifically in the context of brain tumors. She will also discuss current efforts in developing new radiomic features for post-treatment evaluation and predicting response to chemo-radiation treatment. Dr. Tiwari will conclude her talk with a discussion of some of the translational aspects of her work from a clinical perspective."

        abstract: 
            "Modern object detection has relentlessly pursued perfection on a single metric: mean average precision, with impressive gains in performance across datasets and sensor types over that last few years.   I will discuss our multiple contributions in this domain, particularly in 3D object detection with monocular, stereo and LIDAR/camera fusion.  Our work has regularly topped the Kitti Vision Benchmark, and emphasizes the value of attention focused on object shape to enhance localization and extent estimation.

            Despite the strong progress in this domain, current network outputs are primarily deterministic, providing little visibility beyond class confidence as to the probability a detection is accurate.  This makes current object detectors a black box for downstream processes such as tracking and prediction, and can lead to over confidence in low-quality detection.  To help address this challenge, I will discuss our recent work on probabilistic object detectors (PODs) on two fronts.  First, I will describe efforts to place the evaluation of PODs on a secure footing, by introducing proper scoring rules with both local and global extent that can determine whether a predictive distribution is both well calibrated and discriminative.  Then, I will discuss our work BayesOD,  a novel probabilistic object detector that exhibits strong output distribution prediction capabilities and outperforms existing PODs in terms of calibration and sharpness."

        abstract: 
            "Sports analytics is about observing, understanding, and describing the game in an intelligent manner. In practice, this means designing a fully-automated, robust, end-to-end pipeline; from visual input, to player and group activities, to player and team evaluation, to planning. Despite major advancements in computer vision and machine learning, sports analytics is still in its infancy and relies mostly on manually collected data. This talk focuses on the use of broadcast feed for sport analytics, covers the components of a vision system for data acquisition, provides examples of how Sportlogiq captures the data from broadcast videos and finally describes the challenges of deploying vision systems at scale and what Sportlogiq has learnt by processing games from more that 20 different soccer leagues.
